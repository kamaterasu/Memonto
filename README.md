## Why
Your future self forgets flags. Memento learns from `bash`/`zsh` history, scrubs obvious secrets, and turns tricky commands into flashcards. Review for ~5 minutes a day—inside your terminal.


## Features
- 🧠 **Automatic ingest** from `~/.zsh_history` / `~/.bash_history`
- ✨ **Smart heuristics** find long/piped/multi‑flag commands ("tricky")
- 🃏 **Cloze cards** that hide a flag/subcommand
- 📦 **Leitner boxes** (1→5) with sane default intervals
- 🏷️ **Tags** inferred from tools (git/kubectl/ffmpeg/etc.)
- 🔒 **Local‑only storage** (JSON in XDG data dir)

## Privacy
Your history never leaves your machine. We scrub obvious tokens/emails/hex keys during ingest. Review the regexes in `ingest.go` and adjust for your environment.

## Roadmap
- [] Tag filters and multiple‑choice
- [] Import/export anonymized decks
